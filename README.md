## 📖 About This Repository
This repository documents my intensive, self-imposed **"Iron Discipline" Bootcamp**. 
My goal is to transition from zero to a professional Software Engineer capable of building scalable, secure, and efficient enterprise applications within 6 months.

Here, you will find my daily coding exercises, algorithm solutions (DSA), and complex projects, organized by learning phases.
